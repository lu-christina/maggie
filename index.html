                    Maggie is an excellent agent. She sold our house $850k over asking price and broke the price per sqft in 95051. She is very efficient. She sold our house in 7days and she always answers my call promptly with the best solution. She and her team did such a wonderful job designing our house from picking the best color tone, materials and styles for our kitchen, bathroom, and the whole house. The landscaping team changed our front and back yard to unique and water wise. The staging team dressed up our house into a 5 star hotel images and transformed  our sunroom to be so relaxing and charming that we never noticed our sunroom was so valuable before!  She is so professional and truly the best of the best.

                    Maggie is both my buyer agent and also seller agent. She helped me purchase my condo in Sept 2019 and helped me sell it in October 2022 even when the market wasn't good. She has been amazing to work with and I couldn't thank her enough. She is always attentive to details and quick to respond to my inquiries with deep knowledge about the market. Overall, she would go above and beyond to serve her clients and I thank her for all her hard work.

                    With Maggie's great assistance, my family bought our new home in San Jose. It was our first time to buy a house in Bay Area. So many things beard in our minds to be weighed and balanced: price, community, school, commuting traffic etc. Maggie's excellent familiarity with Bay Area neighborhoods provided the greatest information for our decision-making. From preparing a buying offer to closing the deal, she always helped us understand in advance what would be the step-by-step process. With her extensive professional experiences and dedicated assistance, we had peace of mind while going through the longsome and complicated home-buying process. It was a great experience to work with Maggie!
