                    Maggie is an excellent agent. She sold our house $850k over asking price and broke the price per sqft in 95051. She is very efficient. She sold our house in 7 days and she always answers my call promptly with the best solution. She and her team did such a wonderful job designing our house from picking the best color tone, materials and styles for our kitchen, bathroom, and the whole house. The landscaping team changed our front and back yard to be unique and water-wise. The staging team dressed up our house into 5 star hotel-like images and transformed our sunroom to be so relaxing and charming that we never noticed our sunroom was so valuable before! She is so professional and truly the best of the best.

                    Maggie is both my buyer agent and also seller agent. She helped me purchase my condo in Sept 2019 and helped me sell it in October 2022 even when the market wasn't good. She has been amazing to work with and I couldn't thank her enough. She is always attentive to details and quick to respond to my inquiries with deep knowledge about the market. Overall, she would go above and beyond to serve her clients and I thank her for all her hard work.

                    With Maggie's great assistance, my family bought our new home in San Jose. It was our first time buying a house in the Bay Area. So many things in our minds had to be weighed and balanced: price, community, school, commuting traffic etc. Maggie's excellent familiarity with Bay Area neighborhoods provided the greatest information for our decision-making. From preparing a buying offer to closing the deal, she always helped us understand in advance what would be the step-by-step process. With her extensive professional experience and dedicated assistance, we had peace of mind while going through the long and complicated home-buying process. It was a great experience to work with Maggie!

                    Maggie is a great agent helping us to find a great house. She is very professional, quick and knowledge and always follows through with all the requests and documentation. She is very efficient in identifying the house and closing the deal with the seller agent within 1 week. We are very thankful to Maggie and will work with her again and again! We will definitely recommend Maggie to our friends who are interesting in buying houses.

                    Maggie assisted us throughout our first home-buying process. She offered a one-stop service, which included introducing us to bankers with better loan deals and resolving our specific financial issues. Additionally, she recommended a contractor and provided us with refurbishing ideas for remodeling. Maggie empathized with our situation, and helped us secure the best deals. We appreciate Maggie's help and highly recommend working with her.
